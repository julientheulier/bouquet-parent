### Bouquet server installation

Requirements:

- Java 1.7+
- MongoDB
- Redis
- tomcat7
- maven

1. Clone the [Bouquet parent](https://github.com/openbouquet/bouquet-parent) repository
2. Execute the build script to get dependencies and launch the maven install

```
cd bouquet-parent
./scripts/build.sh
```

3. From the Bouquet server directory, edit the Bouquet Server configuration file:

```
cd bouquet-server/config
cp bouquet-sample.json bouquet.json

Open `bouquet.json` file and edit the mongo db connection settings.

4. Launch bouquet server (from maven).
```
cd ..
mvn tomcat7:run
```

5. Check out the server logs in `bouquet-server/target/tomcat/logs/kraken.log` file

6. Check that the Bouquet API is responding by querying the `status` endpoint (All the database connectors are listed by this endpoint) `http://localhost:9000/dev/v4.2/rs/status`

7. Create a new "default" customer with a super-user account

```
curl --form "customerName=default;login=admin;password=<your-password>" localhost:9000/dev/v4.2/admin/create-customer
```

### Bouquet auth installation

cp auth-webapp_sample.xml auth-webapp.xml
```
 
3. Launch Bouquet auth webapp (from maven)

```
cd .. # Should go to bouquet-auth/
mvn tomcat7:run
```

4. Check that the Bouquet auth is responding by querying the `users` endpoint which requires a valid auth token to display the registered user list.
